    <h2>First Entry...</h2>
    <ul>
      <p>So, been thinking about what I have been doing so far. Some learning here and there, figuring things out in work as well, kinda as I go, it's been a bit tough.</p>
      <p>
          Learning Python has been going ok, I have a bit of a block on iterating through lists, indentation, and another thing, but that's in my other notes.
      </p>
      <p>
          I didn't originally plan on a journal (or diary, w/e). But a notion took me. Another way to get more practice I guess!
      </p>
      <p>
          New project I have is Clo's old Win 8 tablet, have a weird tiny Bluetooth keyboard for it, going to see if I can get Linux running on it. Specs aren't great and from some early reading, Linux might run better. But at least I have it up and running with Git, just need to get an Editor for it now, something lightweight.
      </p>
      <p>
          Let's see how this goes then, sporadic updates for the win. Typo's are apologised for in advance. <\3

  <h2>It's been a while...</h2>
  <article>
    <p>So after a bit of a long break from all this I have spent the last few weeks of getting back to basics with some HTML and CSS, and as of today some JS.
    <br>
    The cats have been bold, quarantine has been weird.
    <br>
    I've also discovered a really nice new music genre for concentration music called lofi/chillhop. It might even replace my video game panio soundtracks...
